# Pokemon-App
A Pokemon app that I used to learn about requests and the fetch API.

This is my first project working with the fetch API and GET HTTP requests using a RESTful API.

This app requests data using the fetch API from https://pokeapi.co/ which recieves my request for data and returns it.
This app retrieves the pokemon type and list of moves that they learn as json and formats them before displaying them.

The idea behind this app was to make something that would assist in "Nuzlockes" a type of pokemon game playthrough
where pokemon spawn randomly and the fights are difficult and it would benefit you to counter the opposing pokemon's type.
By entering it's name in the app, you would quickly know it's type and it's moves.


Update: This project was added into my personal portfolio and upgraded from vanilla js to React.js.
Improvements were made to the CSS as well as the addition of loading in the pokemon's sprite image.
